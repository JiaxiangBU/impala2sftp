# impala4sftp

The goal of impala4sftp is to help users who use impala and transfer data by SFTP every workday.

Impala, like Hive is a SQL-like tools to manipulate big data.
However, if users want to transfer the sensitive data to others who have no access to this Impala domain.
SFTP is a option. Thus, this project is to try build a bridge between Impala and SFTP.

Python Code, see [Jupyter Notebook](impala4sftp.ipynb).

# To-do

For the purpose of the end-to-end transferring data files, SFTP is better than HTTP(s).
However, if the file losing, missing happens during the sending process, the reloading mechanism is essential to develop.
The next contribution is to make function more defense.
